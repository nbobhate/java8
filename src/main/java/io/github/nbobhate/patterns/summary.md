# Design Patterns

Some notes about each pattern.

## Creational Patterns

1. **Abstract Factory:** Returns the appropriate interface to create a number of related objects
2. **Builder:** Allows creation of complex objects that have multiple representations
3. **Factory Method:** Hides creation complexity and returns the appropriate concrete instance
4. **Protptype:** Returns instances by cloning stored instances known as prototypes
5. **Singleton:** Guarantees that only one instance exists 

## Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter:** Provides an new interface to allow incompatible interfaces to work together, or translates from one interface to another
2. **Bridge:** Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that they can be changed independently
3. **Composite:** Allows individual or multiple objects to be treated the same, similar to objects in a tree hierarchy
4. **Decorator:** Add behaviour or state without modifying the original object or creating specialized extensions
5. **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to hide the complexities of a system
6. **Flyweight:** Reduces object creation by returning pre-created instances
7. **Proxy:** Act as wrappers or handlers for another class
